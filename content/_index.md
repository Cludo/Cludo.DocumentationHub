Welcome to the Cludo API!

You can use our API to do searches, access your statistics, and manage pretty much anything related to your service. In short - all functionality found in My Cludo can be achieved through the API.


{{< hint info >}}
We're actively working on improving and expanding our API documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, we'd love to <a href="https://www.cludo.com/contact/" target="_blank">hear from you</a>

{{< hint warning >}}
Some features don't work out of the box without using the Cludo JavaScript. You will have to do your own implementation of quicklinks and tracking.
