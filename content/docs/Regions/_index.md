We have our servers located in multiple datacenters around the world. However, it's important that you're interacting with the correct API hostname for the region in which your account was created, as making calls to a different region will be rejected as unauthorized.

To find out which API hostname you should be interacting with, go to the <a href="https://my.cludo.com/settings/api-settings" target="_blank">API Settings</a> page within MyCludo.
